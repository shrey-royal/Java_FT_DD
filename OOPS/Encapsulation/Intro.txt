Encapsulation

-> it is a process of wrapping or binding the data together, so that when needed we can get them all at one place.

-> Package
-> Access Modifiers
-> getter/setter methods

advantages of packages:

1. easily maintainable
2. access protection
3. removes naming collision


-> how to compile a packaged class

javac -d directory javafilename

-> how to run a packaged class

java packagename.classname

ToCompile: javac -d . simple.java
ToRun: java myPackage.Simple
